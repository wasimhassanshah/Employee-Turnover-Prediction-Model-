# Employee-Turnover-Model-RF-LR
Employee-Turnover-Model using Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier
- Employee turnover is a key issue for any organization because of its adverse impact on workplace productivity and long-term growth strategies. 


# Objective
- To understand what factors contributed most to employee turnover.
- To create a model that predicts the likelihood if a certain employee will leave the company or not.
- To create or improve different retention strategies on targeted employees.

The implementation of this model will allow management to create better decision-making actions.

# Method
- Encoded categorical features using dummy variables.
- Performed exploratory data analysis to find the correlation between the features using seaborn and matplotlib library.
- Performed feature elimination to compare models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier
- Fit the model
- showed the most important features which will influence whether an employee will leave the company
